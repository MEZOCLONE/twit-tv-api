# twit-tv-api
Sample code and future HTTP wrapper library for the TWiT.TV API, written in PHP.

The upcoming wrapper library will include response caching, dedicated endpoint methods, and parameter validation in proper *modular* code.

Currently the code examples demonstrate very simple methods to access the API with minimal dependencies (PHP cURL) and turn the response into useful output.
